# Diabetes Prediction Model with Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Overview

This is a Python machine learning model for predicting diabetes using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. It's a tool that takes various health-related features as input and predicts whether an individual is likely to have diabetes or not.
