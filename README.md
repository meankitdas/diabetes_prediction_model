# Diabetes Prediction Model with Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Overview

This is a Python machine learning model for predicting diabetes using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. It's a tool that takes various health-related features as input and predicts whether an individual is likely to have diabetes or not.

## Project Details

- **Algorithm**: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Dependencies**: scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
- **Author**: Ankit Das


## Dataset

The model is trained and tested on a dataset of diabetes-related health information. The dataset includes features like age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and others, which are used to predict the likelihood of diabetes.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/meankitdas/diabetes_prediction_model.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd diabetes_prediction_model

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas

## Usage

1. To train the model, run:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   
This will train the SVM model on the dataset and save the trained model to a file.

2. To make predictions using the trained model, run:

   ```bash
   python predict.py

You can provide input data in the `diabetes.csv` file, and the model will predict diabetes outcomes for each entry.

Modify the code as needed to integrate the model into your applications or workflows.
